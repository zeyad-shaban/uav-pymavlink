This project was made for Roben UAV team for year 2024, this script is now outdated and no longer what we use in our system that's why i posted it public

It had a Genetic Algorithm based path finder built in to find the best path for the plane to follow to throw the payload while being the shortest route, with respect to the turning capabilities of the plane, and not exceeding the fence

It was built in C# for maximum efficiency

Install the needed libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
To run the app open main.py, import the mission you want to run from missions directory, then run the start function of it
